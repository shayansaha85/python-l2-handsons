1. Create file called â€œcalc.py" which has function to find the factorial of a number, function to find the log10 of a number, function to convert degrees to radians, finding the sin, cos and tan trigonometric functions. Write a new program in file "maths.py" such that you import functions of file "calc.py" to your new program. Use from <module> import <function> statement to import only functions a & d from the calc module <br>

2. Write a program to handle the following exceptions KeyboardInterrupt, NameError, ArithmeticError <br>

3. How do you handle exception for the following code? <br>
c = 0<br>
def f2(x): c+= 1<br>
b = x + c print c return b<br>
print f2(1) <br>
print c<br>

4. Translate each of the following English statements into a regular expression:<br>
a. Digit at the beginning of the string and a digit at the end of the string<br>
b. A string that contains only whitespace characters or word characters<br>
c. A string containing no whitespace characters<br>

5. Write a program using re module that loops through the lines of a file or standard input (where each line contains a single word) and prints all words containing two adjacent vowels.<br>

6.  Implement a child class called mathnew and parent classes as sqroot, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Use the super () function to inherit the parent methods.<br>

7. Create a class called First and two classes called Second and Third which inherit from First. Create class called Fourth which inherits from Second and Third. Create a common method called method1 in all the classes and provide the Method Resolution Order.<br>

8. Implement a simple generator for Fibonacci series.<br>

9. Write an iterator class that iterators over a sequence of values in the reverse direction.<br>

10. Implement a decorator that quantifies and returns the execution time of any function.<br>
