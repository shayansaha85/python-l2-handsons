1.	Create file called â€œcalc.py" which has following functions
a.	function to find the factorial of a number
b.	function to find the log10 of a number
c.	function to convert degrees to radians
d.	The sin, cos and tan trigonometric functions

Write a new program in file "maths.py" such that you import functions of file "calc.py" to your new program. Use from <module> import <function> statement to import only functions a & d from the calc module
<br>
2.	Write a program to handle the following exceptions
a)	KeyboardInterrupt,
b)	NameError
c)	ArithmeticError
Note : make use of Try, except, else and finally blocks
<br>
3.	How do you handle exception for the following code? 
c = 0
def f2(x): 
  c+= 1
  b = x + c print c return b
print f2(1) print c
<br>
4.	Translate each of the following English statements into a regular expression:
a.	digit at the beginning of the string and a digit at the end of the string
b.	A string that contains only whitespace characters or word characters
c.	A string containing no whitespace characters
<br>
5.	Write a program using re module that loops through the lines of a file or standard input (where each line contains a single word) and prints all words containing two adjacent vowels
<br>
6.	Implement a child class called mathnew and parent classes as sqroot, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Use the super () function to inherit the parent methods.
<br>
7.	Create a class called First and two classes called Second and Third which inherit from First. Create class called Fourth which inherits from Second and Third. Create a common method called method1 in all the classes and provide the Method Resolution Order
<br>
8.	Implement a simple generator for Fibonacci series
<br>
9.	Write an iterator class that iterators over a sequence of values in the reverse direction
<br>
10.	Implement a decorator that quantifies and returns the execution time of any function
